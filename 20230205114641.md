# ActionPlan

1. Create a pforject with our assets
2. Install the tools we need for C++
3. Learn some C++ basics
4. Make a platform that moves
5. COnfigure our moving platform
6. Send the platform back
7. Rotating platforms

Creating a C++ Actor
C++ code structure
C++ compilation and Live Coding

# First

- create project from `Unreal Lerning Kit` Template
- walk around
- Import `Stylized Chracter Kit`
- Drop `Third Person Character` BP


# Customize Character

Select TPS BP > Blueprint btn > Ceate child blueprint class

Create Subclass

Then, Inherit TPS controller BP & can implement custom logic subclass


# Edit Details

Details > type `auto` to search bar > Pawn > Auto Possess Player > Player0

by Set BP_TPC to Player0, I can control player when start game.

possess = to have something under control, own


# Fix Parent TPC BP class

InputAsxis TurnRate is not defined default UE5

RMB > InputAxis TurnRightRate

# change pin connection

Ctrl + drug : change pin of already connected link

# Change Mesh

BP_TPC > select Mesh (ChracterMesh0) > Detail > Mesh > select something...

If select no compatible SkeltalMesh, then animation is not applied.


# Install Compiler, editor

Unreal engine 5.1 deps

- Visual Studio 2019 > C++ game dev > unreal engine
- VSCode
- .Net 6

# Compile Editor

if want to add C++ script in game, it need to re-compile Unreal Editor.
because C++ source should be compile in binary.

# Change Default Editor

Edit > Editor settings... > Source Code > visual studio code


# Create C++ Class

Tools > Programming > New C++ Class...

Actor > name: MovingPlatform

Then, Editor shows "Recompile Editor" message.
Untill do it, new C++ class doesn't be shown in content manager.

# Open in VSCode

Tools > Generate VSCode project
ContentBrowser > Open in Exprorer > open vscode code-workspace

# Other tools Menu

- Reflesh Proejct : should be executed after compile C++ source

# Error : Generate VSCode project

dotnet command failed? or unreal build tool path is wrong.
Copy executable path & args, then open powershell and paste them and execute manualy.

or, after install dependencies, restart Windows OS and reopen engine.


# Rebuild UE Editor

terminal > Run build tasks (Shift + Ctrl + B)

{ProjectName} editor Win64 development build
or
DebugGame build


If UnrealEditor is running, compiling would fail.

After compile, reopen editor and there is C++ Classes in ContentManager

# UPROPERTY

like Blueprint class, C++ class has some propeties

- variable
- functions
- ...

`UPROPERTY` is C++ macro decolator for member variable of class

```cpp
UCLASS()
class OBSTACLEASSULT_API AMovingPlatform : public AActor
{
...
public:
	UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere)
	int32 MyInt = 99;
};
```

this make var editable in ue editor.

# Actor_.h file

header file is overview of c++ class,
If I want to add something like variable, function, ..., then First edit header file.


# A: Actor prefix

# VSCode Auto save

File > Auto save

# Recompile C++ code for game systems on the fly

right bottom > block? icon button

# Live Coding Issue

Recompile on the fly button's change doesn't remain permanently.
Then, edited values are lost.

It need to `Editor Win64 development build` to change permanently.
(but must close editor while compiling)

# Editor development build vs Live build

prototyping -> Live Build
logic completed & edit in level -> Editor build

# Disable Live coding
if Live coding is disabled, compiled class change becomes parmanent.

# BeginPlay Method

Same as Blueprint's BeginPlay.

It fabaravle exec Super::BeginPlay. (at all other methods)

# Sructs

- FVector: 3 items float
- Vector: 3 items int


# Call C++ Function

1. Add Cube (Static Mesh Component) in Moving Platoform
2. call SetActorLocation() in BeginPlay

AActor::SetActorLocation() method have no effect default, but by adding static mesh component
 Actor has Transform.Location. so it is enable to change loc.


# Copy & paste struct value

it is usefull for copying location

1. select Vector field (like Location, Rotation, ...) > RMB > Copy
2. other Vector field > paste


# Game Loop

1. Process Input
2. Update game state
3. Render to display

Glossary
- Frame : A single picture in a video
- Frame rate
- Tick : function called every frame


# SetLocation on tick

```cpp
void AMovingPlatform::Tick(float DeltaTime)
{
	Super::Tick(DeltaTime);

	MyVector.Z = MyVector.Z + 0.2;

	SetActorLocation(MyVector);
}

```

# VSCode Task: development build vs GameDebug build

The former is no Live Coding, The later is Live coding.

It is able to update editor by launching vscode build task.

# pseudocode

Plain Language description of the steps in an algorithm.
疑似コード

# expression vs statement

expression : fragument of code that produces a value
statement : An action to be performed.


# velocity & deltatime

DeltatTime: Tick argument float. How long between each frames.

FPS is difference between game platform.
But deltatime independent movement behaves the same on fast and slow computer.


# Unreal CPP Naming

Class, variable, function, method = UpperCamelCase
Macro = UPPER_CASE

lower or snake case are not used.

# UPROPERTY(Category)
Category is group of props. It sort params in detail pane.

# UPROPETY(VisibleAnywhere)

```cpp
	UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere, Category = "Moving Platform")
	float DistanceMoved = -1;
```

set -1 for express unmodified.


# Scope Resolution Operator ::

`Class::memberFunction()` ....

`::` : Scope Resolution Operator. Look inside a class. (not instance, but class)

# Blueprint ChildClass

C++ class > inherited Blueprint class

Content Manager > C++ Classes > Create Blueprint Class base on {ClassName}

# BP_TPS, MovedUpdatedComponent 
it's provided by CharacterMoementComponent C++ source

Now BP_PushingCube is added but the character isn't affect location by pushing and cause glitch.

This is because TPS code doesn't process collision when player is not moving.

so, Add Movement per ticking.

BP_TPS > Event tick > MOvedUpdated Component > Delta (1,1,0) > Delta (-1,-1,0)


# GameMode Class

Game Mode is An Actor that controles the 'rule'.

- Who should spawn where

now, BP_TPS props seted player0 auto possess.
So, Player Start or Play From Here menu doesn't works.
It need to enable fom GameMode actor code.

# Create / Edit Gameode

There is the two ways.

Editor > Blueprint Button > 
- Project Settings > GameMode New
  - Create
  - Select GameModeBase Class (After created, select from here, or set from project settings)
- World Override > GameMode Edit ... (BP_LearningKitGameMode)


# Create BP_ObstacleAssaultGameMode

- Create GameMode > GameModeBase Class
  - DefaultPawn > BP_TPSCharacter

Then, some menu works. (PlayFromHere, PlayerStart)

PlayFromHere starts from point clicked by mouse.


# FString

Unreal Engine には FName, FText, FString の 3つの文字列型がある
どうやら C/C++ の標準に属さない独自クラス

マクロで作成する必要がある
作成した値同士で比較できる
FString は 検索、連結、置換ができ、一般的なプログラミング言語の文字列に近い使い方でよく使われる
FName はコンテンツブラウザなどのアセット名に使う


# Logging: UE_LOG macro

```cpp
	FString MyString = GetName();
	UE_LOG(LogTemp, Display, TEXT("%s"), *MyString);
```

UE_LOG() macro is very useful for debugging.

1. CategoryName
2. Verbosity
3. FormatString (generated by TEXT macro)
4. args... 

%s string args require ptr
%f, %d require real value.

# C++: member function

1. Add method to header file
2. Implement cpp

# quick log name

```cpp
	UE_LOG(LogTemp, Display, TEXT("Rotating %s"), *GetName());
```

You can put returning FString ptr directry in UE_LOG args

# Composit Tick function

```cpp
// Called every frame
void AMovingPlatform::Tick(float DeltaTime)
{
	Super::Tick(DeltaTime);
	MovePlatform(DeltaTime);
	RotatePlatform(DeltaTime);
}
```

Tick function usualy have a lot of side-effect.
So in order to make it easy, they should be collected in method per an action.

# Const Member function

Const function can't change Object state & it is forced by compiler.
Otherward it's called as Pure function.

```h
	bool ShouldPlatformReturn() const;
	float GetMovedDistance() const;
```

```cpp
bool AMovingPlatform::ShouldPlatformReturn() const
{
	float MovedDistance = GetMovedDistance();
	return MovedDistance >= MoveDistance;
};

float AMovingPlatform::GetMovedDistance() const
{
	return FVector::Dist(StartLocation, GetActorLocation());
}
```

add `const` keyword after function (h/cpp)
don't use not const function.
don't modify member function.
local variable is available.


# FRotater

3 element vector
but, each elem takes value from -90 to 90 (degree)

So, just adding value over range is not work.
To flip when overflow, use `AddActorLocalRotation(deltaRotation)` method.

# Character on Rotating platform?

Unreal engine basically based on physics engine.
So is AddTransform/Roation/Scale  also effect physics with something conflicting on?
Moving/Rotating platform also moves player on it?

No, PlayerController considering collision.
If player is not moving, Glitch occuers.

# TPSController: Walkking > Walkable Floor Angle

SM_Stair_Floor

Stair Mesh has player collision.
It is almost slope shape.

Player Controller can walk slope by WalkableFloorAngle props.

# BP_Sweeper

1. Create BP from AMobvingPlatform Class
2. Add Gate Static Mesh
3. set Scale.x bigger
4. Add rotation velocity
