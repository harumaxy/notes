# ActionPlan

1. Create a pforject with our assets
2. Install the tools we need for C++
3. Learn some C++ basics
4. Make a platform that moves
5. COnfigure our moving platform
6. Send the platform back
7. Rotating platforms

Creating a C++ Actor
C++ code structure
C++ compilation and Live Coding

# First

- create project from `Unreal Lerning Kit` Template
- walk around
- Import `Stylized Chracter Kit`
- Drop `Third Person Character` BP


# Customize Character

Select TPS BP > Blueprint btn > Ceate child blueprint class

Create Subclass

Then, Inherit TPS controller BP & can implement custom logic subclass


# Edit Details

Details > type `auto` to search bar > Pawn > Auto Possess Player > Player0

by Set BP_TPC to Player0, I can control player when start game.

possess = to have something under control, own


# Fix Parent TPC BP class

InputAsxis TurnRate is not defined default UE5

RMB > InputAxis TurnRightRate

# change pin connection

Ctrl + drug : change pin of already connected link

# Change Mesh

BP_TPC > select Mesh (ChracterMesh0) > Detail > Mesh > select something...

If select no compatible SkeltalMesh, then animation is not applied.


# Install Compiler, editor

Unreal engine 5.1 deps

- Visual Studio 2019 > C++ game dev > unreal engine
- VSCode
- .Net 6

# Compile Editor

if want to add C++ script in game, it need to re-compile Unreal Editor.
because C++ source should be compile in binary.

# Change Default Editor

Edit > Editor settings... > Source Code > visual studio code


# Create C++ Class

Tools > Programming > New C++ Class...

Actor > name: MovingPlatform

Then, Editor shows "Recompile Editor" message.
Untill do it, new C++ class doesn't be shown in content manager.

# Open in VSCode

Tools > Generate VSCode project
ContentBrowser > Open in Exprorer > open vscode code-workspace

# Other tools Menu

- Reflesh Proejct : should be executed after compile C++ source

# Error : Generate VSCode project

dotnet command failed? or unreal build tool path is wrong.
Copy executable path & args, then open powershell and paste them and execute manualy.

or, after install dependencies, restart Windows OS and reopen engine.


# VSCode Build

terminal > Run build tasks (Shift + Ctrl + B)

{ProjectName} Win64 development build
