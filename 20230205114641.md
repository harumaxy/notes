# Unreal Tutorial Udemy section2

# ActionPlan

1. Create a pforject with our assets
2. Install the tools we need for C++
3. Learn some C++ basics
4. Make a platform that moves
5. COnfigure our moving platform
6. Send the platform back
7. Rotating platforms

Creating a C++ Actor
C++ code structure
C++ compilation and Live Coding

# First

- create project from `Unreal Lerning Kit` Template
- walk around
- Import `Stylized Chracter Kit`
- Drop `Third Person Character` BP


# Customize Character

Select TPS BP > Blueprint btn > Ceate child blueprint class

Create Subclass

Then, Inherit TPS controller BP & can implement custom logic subclass


# Edit Details

Details > type `auto` to search bar > Pawn > Auto Possess Player > Player0

by Set BP_TPC to Player0, I can control player when start game.

possess = to have something under control, own


# Fix Parent TPC BP class

InputAsxis TurnRate is not defined default UE5

RMB > InputAxis TurnRightRate

# change pin connection

Ctrl + drug : change pin of already connected link

# Change Mesh

BP_TPC > select Mesh (ChracterMesh0) > Detail > Mesh > select something...

If select no compatible SkeltalMesh, then animation is not applied.


# Install Compiler, editor

Unreal engine 5.1 deps

- Visual Studio 2019 > C++ game dev > unreal engine
- VSCode
- .Net 6

# Compile Editor

if want to add C++ script in game, it need to re-compile Unreal Editor.
because C++ source should be compile in binary.

# Change Default Editor

Edit > Editor settings... > Source Code > visual studio code


# Create C++ Class

Tools > Programming > New C++ Class...

Actor > name: MovingPlatform

Then, Editor shows "Recompile Editor" message.
Untill do it, new C++ class doesn't be shown in content manager.

# Open in VSCode

Tools > Generate VSCode project
ContentBrowser > Open in Exprorer > open vscode code-workspace

# Other tools Menu

- Reflesh Proejct : should be executed after compile C++ source

# Error : Generate VSCode project

dotnet command failed? or unreal build tool path is wrong.
Copy executable path & args, then open powershell and paste them and execute manualy.

or, after install dependencies, restart Windows OS and reopen engine.


# Rebuild UE Editor

terminal > Run build tasks (Shift + Ctrl + B)

{ProjectName} editor Win64 development build
or
DebugGame build


If UnrealEditor is running, compiling would fail.

After compile, reopen editor and there is C++ Classes in ContentManager

# UPROPERTY

like Blueprint class, C++ class has some propeties

- variable
- functions
- ...

`UPROPERTY` is C++ macro decolator for member variable of class

```cpp
UCLASS()
class OBSTACLEASSULT_API AMovingPlatform : public AActor
{
...
public:
	UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere)
	int32 MyInt = 99;
};
```

this make var editable in ue editor.

# Actor_.h file

header file is overview of c++ class,
If I want to add something like variable, function, ..., then First edit header file.


# A: Actor prefix

# VSCode Auto save

File > Auto save

# Recompile C++ code for game systems on the fly

right bottom > block? icon button

# Live Coding Issue

Recompile on the fly button's change doesn't remain permanently.
Then, edited values are lost.

It need to `Editor Win64 development build` to change permanently.
(but must close editor while compiling)

# Editor development build vs Live build

prototyping -> Live Build
logic completed & edit in level -> Editor build

# Disable Live coding
if Live coding is disabled, compiled class change becomes parmanent.

# BeginPlay Method

Same as Bluepriht's BeginPlay.

It fabaravle exec Super::BeginPlay. (at all other methods)

# Sructs

- FVector: 3 items float
- Vector: 3 items int


# Call C++ Function

1. Add Cube (Static Mesh Component) in Moving Platoform
2. call SetActorLocation() in BeginPlay

AActor::SetActorLocation() method have no effect default, but by adding static mesh component
 Actor has Transform.Location. so it is enable to change loc.


# Copy & paste struct value

it is usefull for copying location

1. select Vector field (like Location, Rotation, ...) > RMB > Copy
2. other Vector field > paste


# Game Loop

1. Process Input
2. Update game state
3. Render to display

Glossary
- Frame : A single picture in a video
- Frame rate
- Tick : function called every frame


# SetLocation on tick

```cpp
void AMovingPlatform::Tick(float DeltaTime)
{
	Super::Tick(DeltaTime);

	MyVector.Z = MyVector.Z + 0.2;

	SetActorLocation(MyVector);
}

```

# VSCode Task: development build vs GameDebug build

The former is no Live Coding, The later is Live coding.

It is able to update editor by launching vscode build task.

# pseudocode

Plain Language description of the steps in an algorithm.
疑似コード

# expression vs statement

expression : fragument of code that produces a value
statement : An action to be performed.
